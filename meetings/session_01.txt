Week 1:


Understand the notebook:

- Have a look at stable_baselines documentation;
- Have a look at gymnasium documentation.
 
Complete VIPER algorithm.

Add some comments.

Upload on GitHub source file(s) containing the required functions to achieve VIPER, i.e., functions for getting a RL policy, generating a dataset from it, fitting a decision tree with these data and choosing the best tree among several created this way.

Compare the reward sums of decision trees and RL neural networks.
