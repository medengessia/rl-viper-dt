Week 2:

- Add an argument "reward_weight" in the function for getting data from the generated ones and implement the probability attributions of the paper according to the rewards, i.e. how they choose the data of the decision trees with respect to the rewards.

- Write a document to introduce the project: describe in natural language the purpose of VIPER, that is approximating the behaviour of a RL agent, which is also an approximation.
